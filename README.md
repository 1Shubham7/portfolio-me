# Portfolio

My name is Shubham Singh, and I am a second-year undergraduate student from India.
My passion lies in technology, particularly in cloud-native technologies. I enjoy working
with tools like Kubernetes and Docker, and I love contributing to open-source projects.
Recently, I have been immersing myself in learning in-depth about KubeEdge and
actively contributing to its documentation.

I am an official contributor to CNCF Kyverno and have previously contributed to CNCF
ORAS. Additionally, my professional experience includes roles as a technical writer at
GeeksforGeeks and as a web developer at Hooman Digital
