## CNCF Zero to Merge Incubator

**CNCF (Cloud Native Community Foundation)** Zero to merge is an Incubator program that help you work with CNCF projects, understand large and complex codebases and contribute to them. I was the part of the first cohort of CNCF Zero to merge where I learned about how to get started with contributing to CNCF projects. It was a one month long program where we started with introduction to CNCF and gradually progressed towards how to make contributions to various CNCF projects.

## Learning: 

- Learned in depth about the CNCF Landscape.
- Enhanced my understanding of how to approach open-source projects, specifically CNCF Projects. Learned the correct approach for raising issues, creating PRs and participating in Discussions.
