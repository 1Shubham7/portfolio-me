## About the internship

**The Linux Foundation Mentorship Program (LFX Mentorship)** is 3 months paid internship/mentorship program where people contribute to open source projects. The program aims to foster innovation and talent in the open source community, and to help developers get job and internship opportunities after graduating. The program offers part-time and full-time mentor positions, and mentorships for projects such as CNCF, GraphQL, Hyperledger, LF Networking, Linux Kernel, OpenHPC, Open Mainframe Project, and RISC-V

- I worked as an LFX mentee for the project KubeEdge under my mentors Yue Boa and Fisher Xu. In my mentorship duration I worked on improving the test coverage of the project by writing unit tests, E2E tests and integration tests. I also worked on improving the KubeEdge documentation as well as migrating some tests from standard libraries to more convenient and faster assertion librabies like Testify.
