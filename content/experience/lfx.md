## Outline
Selected as one of 47 mentees globally from thousands of applicants for the Linux Foundation Mentorship program. Worked directly under senior engineers from Huawei and KubeSphere, who are core maintainers of the KubeEdge project. Collaborated closely with maintainers through weekly discussions, providing input on testing strategy and future test development for the project. At the end of the mentorship, was awarded organization membership by KubeEdge in recognition of contributions.

- Increased project test coverage by 20% by writing 20k lines of tests (unit, E2E and integration tests). Developed end-to-end tests for health Probes and Device Plugins, improved integration test scenarios, solved multiple bugs like optimizing db querying etc. And migrated the project to a new assertion library.
- Authored blogs for 7 official KubeEdge releases (v1.10–v1.17) and wrote 2 industry case studies showcasing real world use cases of KubeEdge by companies and universities. Rewrote 20% of the KubeEdge documentation, improving the user journey for local setup, developer guides, and overall usability.
