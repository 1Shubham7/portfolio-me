DevOps can be a bit confusing for beginners, that is because of its complex terminologies. Here are some terms you must know as a DevOps beginner.

***Agile:*** is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer issues.

***Client-server architecture:*** is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.

***A container:*** powered by the containerization engine, is a standard unit of software that encapsulates the application code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings necessary for programmers to efficiently build, ship and run applications.

***Container Registry:*** Used for the storage and distribution of named container images. While many features can be built on top of a registry, its most basic functions are to store images and retrieve them.

***CI/CD pipelines:*** A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle via automation.

***Cloud native:*** A cloud-native application is a program that is designed for a cloud computing architecture. These applications are run and hosted in the cloud and are designed to capitalize on the inherent characteristics of a cloud computing software delivery model.

***Daemon-less:*** A container runtime that does not run any specific program (daemon) to create objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

***DevOps:*** is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.

***Docker:*** An open container platform for developing, shipping and running applications in containers.

***A Dockerfile:*** is a text document that contains all the commands you would normally execute manually in order to build a Docker image. Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.

***Docker client:*** is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

***Docker Command Line Interface (CLI)*** The Docker client provides a command line interface (CLI) that allows you to issue build, run, and stop application commands to a Docker daemon.

***Docker daemon (dockerd)*** creates and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
