So recently, I was setting up locally an open-source software, so to contribute to it (BTW it is called Zulip, Please check it out - it's an amazing org). And its documentation said me to download Vagrant in order to run it locally on Windows. I researched about it and this is what I got to know -

***"Vagrant is a tool that helps developers to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) or lightweight, reproducible development environments."***


It is an open-source tool. It automates the process of creating and configuring virtual machines, making it easier for developers to work on multiple projects with different system requirements on a single machine.

With Vagrant, you can use provisioners to install software, configure environments, and integrate with other tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. You can also share and distribute your VMs easily with your team or community, making it a popular choice for collaborative workflows.

Vagrant can be used with various virtualization technologies, including VirtualBox, VMware, and Hyper-V, on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

And that's it. Thank you for your time. Follow my blog for more such articles.
