Databases: just a digital tool that stores and organizes information in a way that makes it easy to access and merge. Therefore now we can write a technical definition of Databases that is

"In technical language, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically on a computer system. It is designed to efficiently manage, store, retrieve, and update large amounts of data."



so where are databases needed?

anywhere where you can think you need to store data in a proper manner. From your class's students list to Facebook's user list.

types of databases :

Relational Databases - These databases store data in tables with rows and columns, and the relationships between tables are defined by keys.

NoSQL Databases - These databases are designed to handle unstructured data and can store data in a variety of formats, including key-value pairs, documents, and graphs.

Object-oriented Databases - These databases store data as objects, which can include data and code. They are often used in software development. (You must have heard of Object-oriented Programming in Java, c++, etc)

Graph Databases - These databases store data in nodes and edges and are particularly useful for storing data with complex relationships.

Hierarchical Databases - These databases organize data in a tree-like structure, with each node having one parent and multiple children.

Network Databases - These databases store data in a more flexible structure than hierarchical databases, allowing nodes to have multiple parents and children.

Distributed Databases - These databases are spread across multiple computers or servers, allowing for increased scalability and fault tolerance.

And that's it you are done with databases. Make sure to check out our blog on DBMS, the continuation of this topic.
