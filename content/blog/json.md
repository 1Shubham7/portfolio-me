We often come through JSON files during developing web applications. you must have noticed that the JSON files store data in the form of a bunch of key-value pairs. JSON is often used in web development frameworks such as React and Angular, as well as in backend frameworks such as Node.js and Django.

## JSON

***JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.***

## Why is it so widely used?
JSON is very lightweight, easy to read and integrates smoothly with JavaScript. That's the main reason why it is used mostly in web dev, rather than XML. JSON is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, as an alternative to XML. In JSON, data is represented as key-value pairs, similar to objects in many programming languages.

```
{

"name": "Shubham",

"age": 19,

"isMarried": false,

"skills": ["web dev", "devops", "android dev"]

}
```

JSON was first introduced in 2002 by Douglas Crockford, who is also known for his work on JavaScript and the development of the JSON standard. Some alternatives to JSON are XML (Extensible Markup Language), and YAML (Yet Another Markup Language).
