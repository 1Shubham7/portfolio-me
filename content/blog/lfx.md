Contributing to open source, specially to the Cloud Native Community Foundation (CNCF) has been one of the most effective ways for me to learn programming, understand how large codebases work and directly work unedr the guidance of highly talented engineers in the cloud native development space. It's been an year for me as a contributor in the CNCF ecosystem and now as I wrap up my LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program I want to share my journey in open source - from contributing to CNCF projects to getting into the prestigious LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program and completing it successfully.
