Contributing to open source, specially to the Cloud Native Community Foundation (CNCF) has been one of the most effective ways for me to learn programming, understand how large codebases work and directly work unedr the guidance of highly talented engineers in the cloud native development space. It's been an year for me as a contributor in the CNCF ecosystem and now as I wrap up my LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program I want to share my journey in open source - from contributing to CNCF projects to getting into the prestigious LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program and completing it successfully.

## My first contribution to CNCF

I got know about CNCF through YouTube, I heard many engineers in cloud native space talk about CNCF and I went to the CNCF home page but I couldn't understand anything, I think the reasons was that I had never anything similar to that. Is this a company, or is to a project? or is it like a facebook group? But as I leaned more about cloud native technologies like Docker, Kubernetes I understood what CNCF is and what it stands for, by this time I also started searching of some CNCF projects to contribute and one such project was CNCF ORAS (OCI Registries As Service), basically it is a tool for pushing and downloading OCI Artifacts from the OCI Registries. Special thanks to I made my first CNCF contribution in CNCF ORAS 

## Applying for LFX for the first time

I started with changes in readme for the ORAS project and slowly tried understanding the project, watching tutorials, going through docs and trying it locally. I then started contributing to the docs and then made my first code contribution in ORAS. I contributed to ORAS for a month and I wanted to apply for LFX with them but they did not had a proposal for that term so I had to pick up a different project. Later I realized I need to improve my skills before applying to LFX so I skipped that term and rather took an internship offer I had from a startup.

For next few months all my focus was on building projects, learning go and Kubernetes, and working on some internships. If we go back a little bit, when ORAS decided to not come for LFX I started searching for other CNCF projects I that is when I saw KubeEdge, the project I am currently working under and Kyverno where I became an official contributor. So after all this was going I started learning about Kyverno, one of my friends recommended me to contribute to Kyverno and I would also recommend any newbie who wants to start contributing that choose a project that is active, has a really good documentation and maintainers a supportive. Luckily all three projects I have contributed to till now have been amazing and specialy at KubeEdge, we are continuously trying to improve our documentation so if you think you would want to help us, please join the community and contribute.

Tip - Kyverno is also a great project if you are decent at go + Kubernetes since it has very well structured documentation, very active community and helpful maintainers. If you want to start contributing to Kyverno my recommendation would be to start by watching some CNCF talks about what Kyverno is and what it does, then complete the free certification from the nirmata website and then pick up any good first issue from the project (they are very active and frequently post up good first issues to solve).

Even I did the same, I also went through some CNCF talks about Kyverno, completed the certification and then started contributing. I started with some code contributions and then also created a section in their documentation about admission controllers which may go live after some time with changes form the maintainers.

I contributed to Kyverno for a few months while also managing my internship and college classes and finally the time came when projects for LFX term 2 2024 were released.
