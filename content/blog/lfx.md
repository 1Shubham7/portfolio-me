Contributing to open source, specially to the Cloud Native Community Foundation (CNCF) has been one of the most effective ways for me to learn programming, understand how large codebases work and directly work unedr the guidance of highly talented engineers in the cloud native development space. It's been an year for me as a contributor in the CNCF ecosystem and now as I wrap up my LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program I want to share my journey in open source - from contributing to CNCF projects to getting into the prestigious LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program and completing it successfully.

## My first contribution to CNCF

I got know about CNCF through YouTube, I heard many engineers in cloud native space talk about CNCF and I went to the CNCF home page but I couldn't understand anything, I think the reasons was that I had never anything similar to that. Is this a company, or is to a project? or is it like a facebook group? But as I leaned more about cloud native technologies like Docker, Kubernetes I understood what CNCF is and what it stands for, by this time I also started searching of some CNCF projects to contribute and one such project was CNCF ORAS (OCI Registries As Service), basically it is a tool for pushing and downloading OCI Artifacts from the OCI Registries. Special thanks to I made my first CNCF contribution in CNCF ORAS
