      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contributing to open source, specially to the Cloud Native Community Foundation (CNCF) has been one of the most effective ways for me to learn programming, understand how large codebases work and work with experienced engineers on large scale projects. It&amp;rsquo;s been a year for me as a contributor in the CNCF ecosystem and I also have recently completed my LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program as a mentee. As I wrap up my LFX  program I want to share my journey in open source - from contributing to CNCF projects to getting into the prestigious LFX (Linux Foundation Mentorship) program and completing it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Kubernetes Native Policy Management with Kyverno</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/kyverno-intro/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/kyverno-intro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kyverno is a dynamic admission controller that can be used to govern and enforce how a Kubernetes cluster is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;admission-controllers&#34;&gt;Admission Controllers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first start with admission controllers since Kyverno is an admission controller. In Kubernetes admission controllers are used to intercept requests going to the API servier and one of the two or both the things with them - mutate or/and validate. Kubernetes comes up with built-in admission controllers. The issue with these built-in admission controllers is that they are highly specific and different organizations may have different use cases with admission contollers not being fulfilled by these built-in admission controllers, therefore, for meeting these requirements we have dynamic admission controllers that can be developed as extensions and can be run as webhooks configured at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
